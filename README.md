#Biology.js

###Wut?
This is a small project following in steps and based on the [EdX course] (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:EPFLx+NiC1.0x+3T2016/info) **Nature in code** by Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausenne.
The original course is mostly only about implementing evolutionary models in JavaScript.
Here I have taken the idea a bit higher building a simple web application around the core algorithms, implementing things such as WebWorkers and interactive elements.

###TODOs
* [x] course finished
* [ ] config elements added
* [ ] Web Workers replaced by ES6 async JavaScript
* [ ] got bored
